We are committed to building the strongest and most relevant union to bargain on behalf of all members. We are dedicated to providing members with a decent standard of living while ensuring that dignity and respect is part of every workplace.\n\nUnifor Local 2002 represents more than 12,500 members across Canada in all provinces and territories. [Learn More](https://www.unifor2002.org/Unit-Directory/)\n\n## Local 2002 History and Mission\n\n**Unifor’s Mission**\n\nUnifor strives to protect the economic rights of our members and every member of the workforce (employed or unemployed). We are committed to building the strongest and most effective union to bargain on behalf of our members, working with our members to improve their rights in the workplace, and extending the benefits of unions to non-unionized workers and other interested Canadians.\n\n**Unifor’s History**\n\nUnifor was officially formed on August 31, 2013, at a Founding Convention in Toronto, Ontario. It marked the coming together of the Canadian Auto Workers union (CAW) and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP) – two of Canada’s largest and most influential labour unions.\n\nThe birth of Unifor represented a sign of hope for the Canadian labour movement, and working people more generally.\n\nFor decades, union membership (as a share of total employment) had been in steady decline – particularly in the private sector. Running parallel to this decline in union density had been a sharp rise in income inequality, growing threats to retirement security, chronic unemployment and underemployment (particularly for young people) and a noticeable rise in insecure, precarious forms of work, especially among newcomers. The decline of union influence coincided with the rise of grossly imbalanced business-friendly policies, starting in the 1980s, that included tax cuts, labour market deregulation and corporate-led free trade deals.\n\nUnifor was a bold answer to the question: “How do Canadian unions respond to the changing economy and these challenging times?”\n\nIts large and diverse membership (that includes nearly every sector of the economy), makes it one of the most representative voices of our national economy. Its representative organizational structure and innovative forms of membership means it can better address regional economic and political matters on behalf of working people. Its core mandate – to be an effective union that is built by its members and deeply rooted in community – brings Unifor’s work into the day-to-day lives of Canadian families.\n\nThe Unifor project began as a discussion about union renewal in the fall of 2011 between former CAW President Ken Lewenza and former CEP President Dave Coles. Informal discussions led to formal talks among union leadership and staff. A formal discussion paper was prepared, which lead to a comprehensive, open and inclusive union revitalization project, spanning 20-months. Members were invited to follow developments of the New Union Project through regularly published reports, a frequently updated website, and were also asked to participate in telephone town hall meetings and online polls.\n\nFrom its inception, Unifor has become a source of optimism and inspiration that a fairer, more secure future can be won for working people, that unions can adapt to changing times and remain a relevant voice for workplace and social justice.\n\n## Changes and Progress\n\nThe rights we take for granted today were achieved through years of collective struggle for a better tomorrow. This was not easy; workers made incredible sacrifices, so that we benefit from their activism. What follows here is not an exhaustive history of our Local, but simply a highlight of some of the labour gains and the pains that we have endured through the years.\n\n### FIRST CERTIFICATION\n\nOne of the most unpleasant chapters in our nation’s history was the government’s repression over the right for workers to unionize. For generations just mentioning the word union or strike could result in termination, being blacklisted, deported, imprisoned or even violently attacked.\n\nPersecution continued until 1944, when the government – facing growing criticism from its allies as well as the high cost of repressing union activists – passed the Wartime Labour Relations (WLR) Act which recognized the legal status of unions and workers’ rights to collectively bargain. This unleashed a wave of pent-up demand for workers in all industries – including the airline industry – to organize into the unions of their choice.\n\nIn 1946, ninety-six out of ninety-eight eligible passenger agents (forty-one of whom were female) at Trans Canada Airlines (TCA later named Air Canada) signed union cards to organize as the Canadian Airline Passenger Agent Association (CALPAA). In spite of management’s strong protests, the WLR Board granted certification. CALPAA bargained their first contract with TCA on November 8, 1946, paving the way for all of our Local’s members today.\n\nUnfortunately this first agreement entrenched TCA management’s practice of paying its female workers twenty per cent less than their male counterparts for completing the same work.\n\n### THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY\n\n**Gender Pay Parity**\n\nWith the struggle for certification complete, the first fight newly unionized workers challenged was management’s continued insistence of paying female workers less than their male counterparts. This practice was removed in the 1947 collective agreement.\n\nAlthough this was an historic achievement, true workplace equality did not exist between female and male members in the decades that followed due to issues such as the unequal pay between classifications (e.g. reservations agents versus male dominated airport agents) and the inability of workers in lower paid classifications to transfer to the higher paid ones.\n\nPredecessor unions waged constant struggles against this form of institutional discrimination. As a result, many of our collective agreements today have one classification as well as the ability to move between functions without penalty. Unfortunately classification and function divisions still exist; this is still a work-in-progress.\n\n**Marital Status**\n\nOnce a female airline worker got married, she was reduced to casual status and forced to apply to renew her employment status every three months. The 1958 collective agreement ended this discriminatory practice.\n\nDecades later two of our predecessor Locals – 1990 and 2213 – united to support a Supreme Court challenge by a member for the right to same sex spousal benefits. Although the case was initially considered a short term legal defeat, it achieved its ultimate aim by forcing an end to many discriminatory benefits and practices in our industry on the basis of marital status. It is recognized as one of the founding cases that paved the way for the legalization of same sex marriage.\n\nThe “nominated partner” benefits many single workers enjoy today (irrespective of sexual orientation) are a direct result of our Local’s activism for members in a same sex relationship.\n  \n**Employment Status: full time and part time**\n\nEquality of treatment and pay for all workers, irrespective of status, has been another long struggle. In the 1980’s, strikes by our members at Air Canada and Pacific Western Airlines led to ground breaking agreements enshrining equal rights for part time workers. Unfortunately today, third-party contracting within our industry has created a resurgence in inequality for workers.\n  \n**Maternity Leave**\n\nIn the past, airline workers who became pregnant were terminated by their employers. In 1965, progress was finally made by our union granting these workers the ability to request a ‘leave of absence.’ Their return to work was still contingent upon an available vacancy, forcing these workers to essentially re-apply for their jobs without any previous rights. By today’s standards this could hardly be considered a win, but it signaled progress on this issue within our movement.\n\nAirline management refused to make any more concessions whatsoever. This odious treatment of pregnant workers and new mothers continued until 1981 when a strike by the postal workers (represented by CUPW) forced the Canadian government to finally enact maternity leave language for all Canadians. Our predecessor unions were early and vocal supporters of this historic strike. The postal workers faced incredible persecution during their forty-two day strike with several arrests and rabid opposition from the right wing and their anti-union media, but their sacrifice is one of many examples of the hard won gains accomplished by labour solidarity that we take for granted today.\n  \n**Human Rights**\n\nLocal 2002 has been at the centre of some very important struggles throughout its history, pushing for a more tolerant and equal society. Our Local demonstrated leadership on this issue in 2001, by appointing the first human rights coordinator.\n\n### GOVERNMENT RELATIONS\n\nIn spite of the government’s initial opposition to our collective rights as workers, much of our early history saw the government play a mostly positive role in the formation of our industry. Policies such as the ownership of TCA / Air Canada and the regulation of a Canadian based industry ensured a stable environment which fostered the development of a multitude of airlines that thrived in a variety of different networks.\n\nOur Local was at the front of this wave of growth; virtually every airline in Canada had at least one bargaining unit represented by our Local. The Local’s earliest and largest units: Canadian Pacific Air Lines and TCA/Air Canada made industry wide gains and expanded to every corner of the country.\n\nThis was not always easy, nor was the government always accepting of our rights as evidenced by the imposition of Wage and Price Controls in the mid-1970’s which unilaterally rolled back negotiated gains. The government also refused to actively enforce first agreement rights for newly certified airlines like Norcanair. However, due to our industry wide representation, we were largely successful in bargaining respectable contracts and working conditions for our members.\n  \n**De-regulation**\n\nOvernight, what was once a stable industry with good jobs turned into a free-for-all when the pro-corporate Mulroney government in 1984 not only privatized Air Canada, but forcibly de-regulated the Canadian airline industry in 1987.\n\nEvery airline that existed at the time of de-regulation has ceased operations, merged into another entity or restructured through bankruptcy. This one hundred percent failure rate is unprecedented within any industry in Canada.\n  \n**Open Skies**\n\nWith the signing of “Open Skies” agreements, the attacks against airline workers by governments continued. The corporation-ism of Canadian airports caused former department of transport airport workers to lose many benefits including defined benefit pensions for future workers. Wall Street bankers and senior Air Canada Executives pocketed over $4.5 billion from creating independent companies of Jazz, Aeroplan and AVEOS.\n\nThis anti-worker agenda turned from being policy driven into open hostility. In 2011 the Harper government drafted a special bill against the union’s right to strike. Before the bill was passed and criminal charges were laid against our union, the CAW was forced to reach an agreement, ending a three day strike.\n\n### LABOUR RELATIONS\n\nPrior to deregulation an uneasy balance existed with conflicts often limiting the pace of progress for our members.\n\nDe-regulation, the privatization of Air Canada and the corporatization of our airports have permanently destroyed this balance forcing our members to deal with: never ending crises, restructurings, mergers, contracting out of our work, and the outright liquidation of some airlines such as Canada 3000 in 2001.\n\nIt is difficult to make progress when a day does not go by without a crisis in at least one of our units.\n\nTwenty-five years of de-regulation has seen the rapid rise of contract ground handlers. These members face extreme challenges and our ability to make gains for them will be the defining battle of our times. Our Local faces the challenges by aggressively organizing new units to maintain union density.\n\n### UNION ADMINISTRATION\n\nShortly after forming the Canadian Airline Passenger Agent Association (CALPAA) it became very clear that a more formal organization was needed to be an effective union.\n\nTwo approaches were tried: the mostly TCA/Air Canada workers continued building an independent union leading to the eventual formation of CALEA and the mostly CP Air workers joined the American based Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks (BRAC).\n\nBoth groups achieved great gains but the challenges of the 80’s exposed limitations and forced them to increasingly unite due to a rapidly changing industry.\n\nStrikes at both Air Canada and Pacific Western Airlines created great financial strain for CALEA. As employers became more aggressive it became clear that a larger union was needed to have the resources needed to fight their agenda. On August 19, 1985 CALEA formally merged into the UAW / CAW as Local 2213.\n\nThe changes wrought from de-regulation played havoc on representational rights and it was not long before BRAC and CAW 2213 were embroiled in a series of representational votes. These continued until the spring of 1990 when the workers from BRAC formally joined the CAW as Local 1990.\n\nThis duality remained in place until the merger of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International (CAIL) which once again forced representational issues leading to the merger of CAW Locals 1990, 2213 and 4236 (representing Air Nova Maintenance workers in Halifax, Nova Scotia) into CAW Local 2002 in 2002.\n\n### AWESOME POWER OF AIRCRAFT\n\nThe 10,000 members of Local 2002 and all of the retirees are drawn together by the awesome power of aircraft. We fix them; tow them; fuel them; load baggage, cargo and passengers and critically injured people; sell airline tickets and reward programs; prepare the food; schedule crew; and take care of all the complexities of operating an airport: clean runways, ensure security, maintain the baggage belts, assist passengers with parking and even ensure they have a bed to sleep in at their destination. We are all linked by that common thread.\n\nWe work in one of the most difficult, unstable and economically challenging industries that exist. None of our members, regardless of which company they work for have been immune from the attacks of our employers, economy or the government that should be there to protect our rights, not strip them away. As members of Unifor, we are much stronger together. We will continue to draw upon that strength to meet the challenges ahead.\n\n### THE ROAD AHEAD\n\nHistory never stays still and the battles fought today will determine our collective future.\n\nAlthough we work in an industry constantly in crisis, we have always been on the right side of history when it comes to fighting to better the lives of workers and their communities.\n\nCollectively we have made history, particularly in the advancement of human rights. Our challenge as a local is to continue to build on the great legacy built by those who toiled before; the workers of the future deserve no less.\n\n### UNIFOR’S HISTORY\n\nUnifor was officially formed on August 31, 2013, at a Founding Convention in Toronto, Ontario.

Its core mandate – to be an effective union that is built by its members and deeply rooted in community – brings Unifor’s work into the day-to-day lives of Canadian families.\n\nThe Unifor project began as a discussion about union renewal in the fall of 2011 between former CAW President Ken Lewenza and former CEP President Dave Coles. Informal discussions led to formal talks among union leadership and staff. A formal discussion paper was prepared, which lead to a comprehensive, open and inclusive union revitalization project, spanning 20-months.  Members were invited to follow developments of the New Union Project through regularly published reports, a frequently updated website, and were also asked to participate in telephone town hall meetings and online polls.\n\nFrom its inception, Unifor has become a source of optimism and inspiration that a fairer, more secure future can be won for working people, that unions can adapt to changing times and remain a relevant voice for workplace and social justice.",

According to the Canada Revenue Agency, an employer must provide you a T4 slip and file your T4 information return with the CRA on or before the last day of February of the following calendar year to which the information return applies. As February 28, 2021 falls on a Sunday, the employer’s deadline is the next business day (March 1, 2021). For more information or concerns, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency at:\n[canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html](canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html) If you are unable to get clarification with the Canada Revenue Agency, please contact your regional bargaining committee representative.\n\nIn solidarity, \n\n**Your Air Canada Bargaining Committee**\n\nFrances Galambosy, Central Region, Chairperson\n\nTammy Moore, Atlantic Region\n\nBenoit Lapointe, Eastern Region\n\nJoanne Goulet, Western Region\n\nSteve Murphy, Pacific Region\n\nLeslie Dias, Unifor Director – Airlines Sector\n\n## Air Canada Prohibitionary Members: Deployment on Layoff Status\n\n**January 28, 2021**\n\nAs you know the Bargaining Committee last year negotiated a one-year recall for all probationary employees. Many of you have sent emails requesting that the committee negotiate an extension to that year. The company refused to grant an extension; however, they did move the termination date of all employees to June 6, 2021. We have been advised that the employer has adjusted individual records to reflect the new June 6 termination date.\n\nPlease note that flight passes are cancelled once an employee has been terminated.\n\nAdditionally, we asked the company to identify probationary records on a preferential hiring list that can be actioned when the company starts to rehire from the street. As of yet the company has not responded to this request.\n\nFurther information will be communicated as it becomes available.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\n**Your Air Canada Bargaining Committee**\n\nFrances Galambosy, Central Region, Chairperson\n\nTammy Moore, Atlantic Region\n\nBenoit Lapointe, Eastern Region\n\nJoanne Goulet, Western Region\n\nSteve Murphy, Pacific Region\n\nLeslie Dias, Unifor Director – Airlines Sector\n\n## Air Canada - Inactive Status Mailing List Please Sign Up\n\n**18 December 2020**\n\nDear Member,\n\nYour Unifor 2002 bargaining committee is pleased to announce the launch of an electronic news service specifically for inactive Air Canada members of Unifor 2002.

The department coordinates workplace anti-harassment initiatives, complaint investigation and offers general human rights training programs which assist members in the fight against harassment and discrimination based on race, colour, sex, creed, sexual orientation, disability, religious beliefs or any other prohibited ground.\n\nOur mission is to promote healthy and respectful workplaces by providing support and assistance to those who may be experiencing harassment and discrimination based on the prohibited grounds and personal harassment (bullying).\n\nWe recognize education as a means to achieve our mission and provide general education on harassment, discrimination and bullying.  We also will conduct investigations of complaints in workplaces where joint investigations have been bargained with the employer.\n\nIf you have questions about Canada’s human rights policies or have experienced a human rights violation, please contact us. All queries will be kept strictly confidential.\n\nAviva Atlani\n\n[aatlani.unifor2002@gmail.com](mailto:aatlani.unifor2002@gmail.com)\n\nCate Moss\n\nLocal 2002 National Human Rights Co-ordinator\n\nMobile: [(514) 891-4062](tel:514-891-4062)\n\n## Together We Can Make a Difference Campaign\n\nThe Globe represents the diversity in our workplaces, i.e. our UNIFOR members, from different nations, ethnic and religious backgrounds from across the globe\n\nThe Arrows point inward into the globe, showing that all workers can be affected in the areas mentioned, regardless of their culture, religion, able-ness. Whatever the diversity, the intent can affect everyone\n\nThe colours of the arrows represent our diversity and that our differences do not prevent us from working together towards our common goals and to make a difference\n\nIntentions within the Arrows represent and speak to different human rights issues that we advocate for and have promoted on the website through different articles marking important dates based on the prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Human Rights Commission\n\n- **Stop and think. Circumstances could change your life**:\nSpeaks to workers with disabilities, invisible and visible. Many workers with disabilities are often judged by what others believe they can or cannot do. So the reader is asked to stop and think and that at any given moment they could be “that” person with a disability.\n \n- **When we stop judging, we start learning**:\nThis speaks to discrimination, i.e. racial, homophobia, religion, etc.\n \n- **Let’s talk, let’s educate, let’s advocate**:\nThis speaks to our overall mandate that through education we promote respect.\n \n- **Embrace our diversity. Welcome our differences**:\nRefers to Aboriginal workers and workers of colours\n \n- **Equality for all. Respect our rights**:\nRefers to Human Rights Day and the Declaration of Human Rights\n \n- **Be the change. Step up and others will follow**:\nRefers to being an ally and to lead by example. When we step up and do the right thing it instills confidence in others and they will want to follow and be part of the change.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nThe campaign is targeted to all our members and the poster will be distributed to all districts and placed on union bulletin boards and union offices allowing for a constant visual in the workplace. Promotion on Local’s website explaining the campaign and how together our members can promote respect and make a difference in our workplace, our daily life and community.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nAs a group, we want our members to think about human rights daily, and how together we can make a difference. By doing so we become stronger when we promote these rights collectively. We hope you will see the importance and impact of this campaign, and how it could benefit our members throughout their work environment and everyday life.\n\n[Cate Moss](mailto:cate@unifor2002.org)\n\nLocal 2002 National Human Rights Co-ordinator\n\nMobile: [(514) 891-4062](tel:514-891-4062)\n\n## Local 2002 Human Rights Advisors\n\n- Aviva Atlani\n- Kim Driedger\n- Manon Boucher\n- Manon Camiré",

    "content": "## Anti Scab Law Now\n\nDear members, locals, staff and all leadership, Please take two minutes right now and help us make history in Canada’s labour movement. Sign Unifor’s petition demanding anti-scab legislation at this\n[link](https://www.unifor.org/en/take-action/campaigns/anti-scab-legislation-now).\n\nYesterday our union launched our Anti-Scab Law Now campaign at Prairie Regional Council, and released a research paper called\n*[Fairness on the line: The case for anti-scab legislation in Canada.](https://www.unifor.org/en/fairness-line-case-anti-scab-legislation-canada)*\nThis study includes internal data and analysis we’ve never publicly released before, detailing the cold hard facts on the negative impact scabs have on resolving labour disputes. Simply put, the use of scabs undermines worker’s collective power, unnecessarily prolongs labour disputes, and removes the economic pressure that the withdrawal of labour is supposed to give workers to help end a dispute. Many of you know first-hand the kind of damage scabs cause in our fight to create good, stable and safe jobs for workers in Canada. It’s no surprise that the three longest labour disputes in Unifor’s history involved the use of scabs, and a review of all Unifor labour disputes shows those involving scabs lasted on average six times longer than those without scabs. Every federal and provincial legislator received a letter from Unifor yesterday sharing this new report and our [list of recommendations](https://www.unifor.org/en/take-action/campaigns/anti-scab-legislation-now?v=recommendations) for this legislation that is long overdue. Watch the [new video](https://youtu.be/xrBrO1n_Huk) as members speak out about the damage and pain scabs bring to the workplace. A federal anti-scab law will mean more power for workers, and shorter strikes and lockouts. [Add your name to the petition right now](https://www.unifor.org/en/take-action/campaigns/anti-scab-legislation-now?v=full).\n\nIn solidarity,\n\n**Jerry Dias**\n\n**National President** ***\n\n[https://www.unifor.org/en/take-action/campaigns/anti-scab-legislation-now](https://www.unifor.org/en/take-action/campaigns/anti-scab-legislation-now?v=full)\n\n## Shame on Bell\n\nEstablished 144 years ago, Bell has evolved into Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. (BCE Inc.), commanding the helm as Canada’s leading communications conglomerate. Now the company has been tarnished by the irresponsible and callous decisions by the Bell Board of Directors.\n\nBCE’s systematic reduction of telecommunication jobs, outsourcing practices, offshoring endeavors, and the relentless downsizing of TV and radio newsrooms across the nation have cast a shadow over its legacy. Meanwhile, payouts to shareholders and executive board members have soared, exacerbating the growing chasm between corporate wealth and worker stability.\n\nIn a stunning blow to its workforce, February 2024 saw Bell axing an additional 4,800 jobs – a staggering 9% of its employees. More than 800 Unifor members, comprising 700 in telecommunications and more than 100 in media, found themselves abruptly terminated, casualties of a corporate ethos that prioritizes shareholder dividends over employee livelihoods.\n\n**Bell is a communications company with no moral fibre. While BCE points fingers at governmental policies, it cannot escape accountability for its actions.**\n\n[Click through here](https://www.shameonbell.ca/) and make your voice heard, stand in solidarity. Contact the Bell Board through their webform and let them know that Canadians deserve better.",
